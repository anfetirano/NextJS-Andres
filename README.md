# Next.js Dashboard Project

This is my learning project, built as part of my journey to master **Next.js**, **React**, and **TailwindCSS**. The goal of this project is to apply concepts like:

- Dynamic routing 
- Layouts and shared components
- Database integration with PostgreSQL
- Client-side and server-side rendering
- UI design with TailwindCSS

This project is a work in progress, and I'm actively improving it as I learn more.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to reach out!
